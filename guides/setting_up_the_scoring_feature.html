<h1 class="header"> Setting up the scoring feature </h1>
<p class="summery">Here's a guide to use one of Inkxbot's features, this is a quick guide so it's not that long.<br />
So you came to this page to learn how to set up the scoring feature for your team right? Well let's get down to buisness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First create a text channel on your server called <b>#scrim-scores</b> or <b>#results,</b> make sure Inkxbot has permissions to send messages to that channel.<br />
<br />
Finaly you'll need to write your team's name to Inkxbot's database with <code>,wt "YOUR TEAM'S NAME HERE"</code> <br />
<br />
You're all set! The scoring feature is set up!<br />
Now since it's ready for scores of scrims, you can just log them with <code>,post scrim {your teams score} "the opposing team's name" {the opposing teams score}</code>
<br />
