Some people get confused when they try to use <b>,seturl</b> properly. Some people might remove Inkxbot because it didn't work for them.<br />
To avoid that, there will be a tutorial here on how to use <b>,seturl</b> correctly for your tournaments.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, let's see what your url is. Is it a custom url? A url that's not affilaited?<br />
<br />
Below are some guides for affilaited and non-affilaited urls<br />
<br />

            <h2> Guide for non-affilaited urls </h2>
            <br />
            Let's say your url is like
            <a href="http://challonge.com/d4q8b4yb">
                this.<br>
            </a>
                <br />
                Since this guide is a simple proccess, all you need to do is to remove <b>http://challonge.com/</b> from it.<br />
                <br />
                You are left with some letters and numbers from it, this is part of your tournament's id.<br />
                <br />
                You will then use this as your characters for your challonge data.<br />
                <br />
                So then all you have to do is <b>,seturl (your tournament's id here)</b> and you're all set! Your tournament is registered in the database within 15 seconds!<br />
            <br />
            <h2> Guide for affilaited urls </h2>
            <br />
            Now let's say your url is like any other Challonge url, BUT it's affilaited with custom affilaited assets.<br />
            <br />
            The only way to extract the tournament's id in this senario is from veiwing the page's source.<br />
            This is simple for Chrome browsers to do this thing because it has an option to veiw the pages source.<br />
            <br />
            In the pages source, use <i>Ctrl + F</i> to find a line of text that is called <b>resource_id =</b> <br />
            Next to the <i>=</i> in <b>resource_id</b>, you will find some numbers. Those numbers are also your tournament's id.<br />
            <br />
            So like the last guide, you have to do <b>,seturl (tournament's id here)</b> and boom! That's it! Your tournament is registered in the database!<br />
